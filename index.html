    <h2>About RSE'22</h2>
    <p>
       Robotics and Software Engineering 2022 (RSE'22) is intended to be a yearly unofficial meeting to promote discussion and interaction between researchers. The main objective is to strengthen cooperation and dialogue, bringing together the communities of Robotics and Software Engineering in this first edition of the meeting. It is an ideal opportunity to exchange ideas on topics of interest, including (but not limited to): development of systems, software architecture, dependability, software reuse, software validation and verification, robot modeling, robot control architectures, multi-robot systems, autonomous systems.
    </p>
    <p>
       The format of RSE'22 meeting consists of short presentations from each participant with enough time for discussion. Researchers at different career stages are wellcome to present their research, provide and get feedback from peers, engage into discussions and establish new collaborations. RSE is not a publication venue. Participants can present previously published work as well as unpublished work, including early ideas and work in progress, can be a published paper, an idea, a master thesis, etc. The main point is to encourage discussions, to give and receive feedback, and to create a network for new collaborations.
    </p> 
    <p>
        In this first edition, we plan for two and a half days event, and departure on Saturday. To apply, the participant must fill the Google Form available <a href="https://forms.gle/qjfDbdCytcpyADjg8">here</a> with title and an abstract, <b>until July, 23</b>. RSE'22 does not require any paper submission, however, it is required an abstract about the research that is to be presented and an e-mail address of the participant. <b>It is important to say that every participant needs to give a talk, this is the event rule</b>. The program will be dynamic, that is, we'll only provide the schedule the evening before each day, but it's flexible in the sense that one can jump in if the talk fits well as a follow-up to another talk. Thus, everyone should be prepared to give the talk any time, which gives synergy to the event.
    </p>
    <p>
       RSE'22  will take place at the <a href="https://www.gssi.it">Gran Sasso Science Institute</a> located in L'Aquila-Italy, from September 7 until September 9, 2022.
